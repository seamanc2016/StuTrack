## Updates:
- MongoDB integrated as database for the application.
- Webpages are now rendered using EJS.
- listStudents page now has a search feature.
- Unnecessary packages were removed (glob)
- Unnecessary code culled (includes all related to previous storage system, like fs for example)

**Other than that, the functionality of the application is still the same.**
